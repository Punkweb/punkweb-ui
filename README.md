# punkweb-ui

CSS Framework for Punkweb.

The primary goal of this project is to create a CSS framework that can be used for the following use cases:

- As a standalone minified CSS file, for projects using only browser CSS
- As a modular system for projects using SCSS

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will watch SCSS files for changes and run lite-server for hot reloading
